Version 0.3.1 - Mechanics showcase

Enter Poppy, your perpetually peppy member of an idol unit. She lives the normal idol life, as one does. And yet a single chance encounter is all it takes to disturb her agency's sleepless secrets.

Idoll is a top-down/2D/pixel/horror RPG, with a few sprinkles of comedy. Uncover the secrets of the idol agency by investigating the environment, conversing with characters, and most intuitively, by switching out your eye!

Made during ACM Studio's SRS2023!
