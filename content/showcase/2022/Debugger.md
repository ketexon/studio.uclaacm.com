For the best experience, play in full screen mode with sound on.

The full screen button should be found in the bottom right below the game screen. If parts of the screen are cut off, zoom out of the web page with CTRL+- (minus key).

We developed a [demo](https://raddishradish.itch.io/debugger-srs) January 2022 - May 2022 as part of [Students Run Studios](https://itch.io/c/2529704/students-run-studios-2022), a program by [ACM Game Studio at UCLA](https://uclaacmstudio.itch.io/) through which students learn to develop a game collaboratively over two  school quarters. Our team consists of 10 UCLA students and 2 friends from UCSD.

In Summer 2022, the team members marked with an asterisk added content and quality of life improvements to the game.
